Given an integer N (1 <= N <= 1000), output any list of N (possibly non-distinct) primes such that each prime is at most 10^6, and such that the product of the N primes has exactly N digits.

Input Format:

The first line contains 1 integer, T (1 <= T <= 50), the number of test cases. Then, for each test case:

Line 1: 1 integer, N

Output Format:

For each test case:

N integers, a list of primes whose product has exactly N digits.

Sample Input:

2
1
2

Sample Output:

5
3 7

Sample Explanation:

In the first case, the product is simply 5, which has the required digit count of 1.

In the second case, the product is 3 * 7 = 21, which has the required digit count of 2.

Note that various other outputs would also be accepted for each case.
