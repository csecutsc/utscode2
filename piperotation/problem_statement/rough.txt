Pipe Rotation
-------------

There's a grid with R rows and C columns (1 <= R, C <= 100). The cell in row r and column c contains one of 4 things (identified by a letter G_{r,c} between "A" and "D"), and can be rotated by any multiple of 90 degrees:

  - A: Nothing
  - B: A straight pipe (with pipes leaving through 2 opposite edges)
  - C: An elbow-shaped pipe (with pipes leaving through 2 adjacent edges)
  - D: A four-way pipe (with pipes leaving through all 4 edges)

Determine whether or not it's possible to rotate the cells such that the pipes all line up with one another. In particular, for each edge shared by a pair of adjacent cells, there must either be a pipe on both sides of that edge, or on neither side. And for each each of the 2*(R+C) outer edges of the grid, there must be no pipe leaving through that edge.

Example grid specification with R=3 and C=4:

  CBCA
  BCDC
  CCCC

Example invalid grid:

Example valid grid:

Input Format:

The first line contains 1 integer, T (1 <= T <= 50), the number of test cases. Then, for each test case:

Line 1: 2 integers, R and C
Next R lines: C characters, G_{i,1..C}, for i=1..R

Output Format:

For each test case:

1 string, either "Possible" if it's possible to produce a valid grid, or "Impossible" otherwise

Sample Input:

Sample Output:

Sample Explanation:

In the first case, the following valid grid may be produced:

In the second case, no matter how the cells are rotated, one of the ends of the straight pipe (in the bottom-right corner) will always leave through an outer of the grid, which is invalid.
