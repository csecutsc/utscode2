Pipe Rotation
-------------

There's a grid with R rows and C columns (1 <= R, C <= 200). The cell in row r and column c contains one of 4 things (identified by a letter G_{r,c} between "A" and "D"), and can be rotated by any multiple of 90 degrees:

  - A: Nothing - 1 possible rotation
  - B: A straight pipe (with pipes leaving through 2 opposite edges) - 2 possible rotations
  - C: An elbow-shaped pipe (with pipes leaving through 2 adjacent edges) - 4 possible rotations
  - D: A four-way pipe (with pipes leaving through all 4 edges) - 1 possible rotation

Determine whether or not it's possible to rotate the cells such that the pipes all line up with one another. In particular, for each edge shared by a pair of adjacent cells, there must either be a pipe on both sides of that edge, or on neither side. And for each each of the 2*(R+C) outer edges of the grid, there must be no pipe leaving through that edge.

Input Format:

Line 1: 2 integers, R and C
Next R lines: C characters, G_{i,1..C}, for i=1..R

Output Format:

1 string, either "Possible" if it's possible to line up the pipes, or "Impossible" otherwise

Sample Input 1:

2 2
CC
CC

Sample Output 1:

Possible

Sample Input 2:

2 2
CC
CB

Sample Output 2:

Impossible

Sample Explanations:

In the first case, the 4 elbow-shaped pipes may be rotated to line up with one another in a single closed loop. That's the only valid way to rotate the cells.

In the second case, no matter how the cells are rotated, one of the ends of the straight pipe (in the bottom-right corner) will always leave through an outer of the grid, which is invalid.
