Tree
----

Compute the expected height of a random Binary Search Tree (BST) with N (1 <= N <= 500) nodes. The height of a tree is defined as the longest distance from the root to any node (for example, the height of a tree consisting of 1 node is 0). The tree is generated by selecting a random permutation of the integers 1..N (drawn uniformly at random from the set of all N! possible permutations), and then inserting the integers one-by-one in the chosen order into an initially-empty BST.

Input Format:

The first line contains 1 integer, T (1 <= T <= 500), the number of test cases. Then, for each test case:

Line 1: 1 integer, N

Output Format:

For each test case:

1 real number, the expected height of the BST. Your answer must have at most 10^{-5} absolute or relative error to be considered correct.

Sample Input:

2
2
3

Sample Output:

1.00000
1.66667

Sample Explanation:

When N=2, both possible trees have a height of 1.

When N=3, 2 of the possible trees have a height of 1, and the remaining 4 possible trees have a height of 2, resulting in an expected height of (1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2) / 6 = 5 / 3.
