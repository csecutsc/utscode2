Tree
----

Compute the expected height of a random Binary Search Tree (BST) with N (1 <= N <= 300) nodes. The tree is generated by selecting a random permutation of the integers 1..N (drawn uniformly at random from the set of all N! possible permutations), and then inserting the integers one-by-one in the chosen order into an initially-empty BST.

Input Format:

Line 1: 1 integer, N

Output Format:

1 real number, the expected height of the BST. Your answer must have at most 10^{-5} absolute or relative error to be considered correct.
