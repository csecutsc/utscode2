\noindent Cob and his gang of thieves are offered the impossible task: Plant an idea in someone's mind. Using dream-sharing technology, they find that time slows down depending on whose dream they enter. Their target is to convince Fischer, the heir of an energy conglomerate, to dissolve his father's company. \\

\noindent Cob needs to enter several levels of dreams to ensure he has just enough time to compromise Fischer. Entering the dream of the host allows Cob's gang to move down a level, while entering a dream that isn't Fischer's allows them to move rightwards - forming a rather unusual triangle. \\

\noindent 1 3 6 10\\
 2 5 9\\
 4 8\\

\noindent Cob wants to know how much time slows down by given how far they need to travel rightwards, $R$, and downwards, $D$. \\

\section*{Input}
The input will be a single line consisting of 2 numbers; $R$ and $D$ where $1 \leq R, D \leq 2^{31} - 1$

\section*{Output}
Output the factor at which time slows down by.
