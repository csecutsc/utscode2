Given an integer N (1 <= N <= 1000), output any list of N (possibly non-distinct) primes such that each prime is at most 10^6, and such that the product of the N primes has exactly N digits.

Input Format:

Line 1: 1 integer, N

Output Format:

N integers, a list of primes whose product has exactly N digits.

Sample Input 1:

1

Sample Output 1:

5

Sample Input 2:

2

Sample Output 2:

3 7

Sample Explanations:

In the first case, the product is simply 5, which has the required digit count of 1. In the second case, the product is 3 * 7 = 21, which has the required digit count of 2. Note that various other outputs would also be accepted for each case.
