\noindent Dr. Thanos, a data scientist and a self-described nihilist, recently published a paper titled "The Snapping Point of the Universe: Why Rates of Population Growth Points toward Imminent Destruction". In his paper, Thanos explains that in many planets, the increasing population count is leading to a diminished quality of life. He is convinced that his findings can lead to sweeping reforms in intergalactic law, and lead to a better life for all lifeforms.\\

\noindent Thanos turns to you, his confidant, and asks that you do some investigation for him so that he has some examples to point to when he presents his findings to the Association of VENGE's Research Society. The society, one of the galatic leaders in egalitarianism and social justice, is holding a panel to discuss Thano's findings, and contemplate possible legislative moves, so Thanos is convinced that they are going to be a tough crowd. He asks you to investigate several datasets and see if they could be potentially helpful in supporting his argument.\\

\noindent Thanos hands you information regarding several planets. On each file, you see the current population - $x$, population growth rate - $y$, and total annual resources produced for each planet - $z$. Given this information, your job is to find out the number of years the planet has left before the population is no longer sustainable on its resources. Assume that each person consumes one unit of resources per year, and that population will always need to be a whole number, rounded down.\\

\noindent For each planetary study, Thanos desires to know the number of years it will take before the planet is no longer sustainable for its population\\

\section*{Input}
The input will be $n$+1 lines, the first line, $n$, describes the number of planets to analyze.
The remaining $n$ lines each have single line consisting of 3 numbers; $x$, $y$, and $z$ where $1 \leq w, x, y, z \leq 2^{31} - 1$ where each is a metric of planetary study as described above.

\section*{Output}
Output the number of years each planet has before it is no longer sustainable
